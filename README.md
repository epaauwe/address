# address
Address book
ultimately will connect to remote SQL Server instance to retrieve address info, based on user input of firstName and lastName

Currently asks user at the cmd for state ID and retrieves all cities in that state; this indicates healthy DB connection and SQL execution
Address DB needs to be fleshed out, yet

Also have a rough GUI

TODO
add button that SELECTs all records
